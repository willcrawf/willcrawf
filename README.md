I'm a **Software Engineer and IT Coordinator** with a keen interest in **Web Development, Machine Learning, Design, and Mobile App Development**. My journey in tech started as a bootcamp graduate, followed by a path of self-learning and immense self-motivation. My philosophy in this coding world is simple: **Don't be afraid to ask for help**. 

Currently, I'm dedicating my efforts to modernize a React project from 2016 and transition an internal ASP project from 2003 to the latest tech standards. These projects involve intricate tasks such as transitioning from the FedEx API to the UPS API and managing direct databases.

- 🔭 Projects: **Modernizing React & ASP projects**
- 🌱 Learning: **C#, OpenAI APIs**
- 🎓 Background: **Bootcamp grad, self-taught & self-motivated**
- 🎮 Hobbies: **Gaming, spending quality time with my dog, watching sports (especially football), enjoying a drink with friends, hiking, camping, family time, reading, listening to podcasts & music, and dabbling in hardware.**
